# Neovim-Erix
My Personal Nvim installation

Package Manager: Mason
Plugin Manager: Lazy-Nvim


#Known Issues:
 - miniicon does not display icons properly in Fedora-42-wayland gnome shell, better to use kitty-kitten shell.
 - TreeView is not toggling ON by default, I tried to set option via vim.cmd in lazy.lua but no luck, try using ALT+t to activate or deactivate it
 - barbar is not displaying exit icon Correctly, I'm not sure if it's miniicon issue with nvim-web-devicons or not?
