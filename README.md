#Known Issues:

 - TreeView is not toggling ON by default, I tried to set option via vim.cmd in lazy.lua but no luck, try using ALT+t to activate or deactivate it
 - ~~barbar is not displaying exit icon Correctly, I'm not sure if it's miniicon issue with nvim-web-devicons or something else!!~~ --> Need to install nerdFonts into system as Docs Said.
 - ~~miniicon does not display icons properly in Fedora-42-wayland gnome Terminal, better to use kitty Terminal.~~  --> resolved by fixing barbar issue! but still I liked kitty
